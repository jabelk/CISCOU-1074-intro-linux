"Having a working knowledge of Linux is quickly becoming a very useful skill for network engineers. Whether you are trying to navigate around a jump-host to connect to a locked down secure network device or troubleshooting a script in your development environment, Linux comes up again and again. This session is meant for network engineers with minimal knowledge of Linux.
Learn things like:
·         How to navigate around the Linux system CLI
·         Editing files without getting stuck
·         Saving your SSH session on a jump host to a file, so you can reference the output later "
